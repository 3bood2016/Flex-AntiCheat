Welcome to my AntiCheat project called Flex. In this project, I optimize AntiCheats with better and advanced configs.

This, of course, helps to reduce false positives and bypasses. And what's beautiful is that it's completely free.

Currently there is an AAC and AntiAura version.

![About-Flex](https://directleaks.com/attachments/about-flex-png.41190/)

Flex AntiCheat has started on 15-03-2017 on BlackSpigotMC and has been in development since then.

It was so popular that I decided to place it on multiple sites including DirectLeaks and now GitHub.

Currently we already have version 3 and already have almost 10000 total downloads on all versions that have ever been released.
