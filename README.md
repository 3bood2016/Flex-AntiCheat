Welcome to my project called Flex. In this project I optimize AntiCheats with more advanced configs.
My goal with Flex is to give AntiCheats less false positives and even try to prevent bugs or bypasses.

Currently there is an [AAC](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AAC), [AACAdditionPro](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AACAdditionPro) and [AntiAura](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AntiAura) version available.

My config has some special features for every config and AntiCheat.

The AAC version has an improved config layout, better and easier to understand notes for the settings of a check, a lot of language errors fixed, ConditionalCommands support for TPS, Ping, uptime, playtime and false kicks protection and not to forget, optimized config values.

The AACAdditionPro version has an improved config layout, better and easier to understand notes for the settings of a check, a lot of language errors fixed, ConditionalCommands support for TPS, Ping, uptime, playtime and false kicks protection and not to forget, optimized config values.

The AntiAura version has an improved config layout, better and easier to understand notes for the settings of a check, a lot of language errors fixed and not to forget, optimized config values.
