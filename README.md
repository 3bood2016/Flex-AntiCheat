Welcome to my project called Flex. In this project I optimize AntiCheats with more advanced configs.
My goal with Flex is to give AntiCheats less false positives and even try to prevent bugs or bypasses.

Currently there is an [AAC](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AAC), [AACAdditionPro](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AACAdditionPro) and [AntiAura](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AntiAura) version available.

My config has some special features for every config and AntiCheat.

The AAC version has an improved config layout, better and easier to understand notes for the settings of a check, a lot of language errors fixed, ConditionalCommands support for TPS, Ping, uptime, playtime and false kicks protection and not to forget, optimized config values.

The AACAdditionPro version has an improved config layout, better and easier to understand notes for the settings of a check, a lot of language errors fixed, ConditionalCommands support for TPS, Ping, uptime, playtime and false kicks protection and not to forget, optimized config values.

The AntiAura version has an improved config layout, better and easier to understand notes for the settings of a check, a lot of language errors fixed and not to forget, optimized config values.

There are a number of things required to use Flex as an AntiCheat on your server. If you do not stick to this, Flex will not work correctly and the consequences may be, hackers that bypass the checks or false positives.

If you want to use AAC (and AACAdditionPro) as AntiCheat, you have to keep to the following:

1. The server must be in good condition to keep the TPS high. The minimum to avoid the false positives must always be higher than 19 (19.5 and higher is the best). When the TPS falls below 19.5, the detection will go slower to prevent further false positives.

2. Buy AAC [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/aac-advanced-anti-cheat-hack-kill-aura-blocker.6442/).

3. (Additional) Buy AACAdditionPro [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/aacadditionpro.33590/).

4. (Recommended) Download ConditionalCommands [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/conditionalcommands.14295/).

5. Copy the latest Flex build for AAC [HERE](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/blob/master/AAC/LATEST%20PUBLIC%20BUILD.yml) and for AACAdditionPro [HERE](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/blob/master/AACAdditionPro/LATEST%20PUBLIC%20BUILD.yml) into the existing config of the AntiCheat. Also look at the spacing before run the config or you will get a error.

6. Always check the config before you use it on your server. Sometimes you do not want to use certain checks or things that have to do with ping or TPS detection. If you need further assistance you can always make a report [HERE](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/issues).

If you want to use AntiAura as AntiCheat, you have to keep to the following:
